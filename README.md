## Overview

This project aims at reading the data of a Time-of-Flight VL53L5CX sensor from STMicroelectronics. The sensor is connected through I2C and the data is sent via serial.

### Hardware Required

Two basic things are required for this project to run: a VL53L5CX ToF sensor and an ESP32-C3 (it could work with other ESP32 models as well).
